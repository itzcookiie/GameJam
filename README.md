# Tetris

## Quick journal
- Ended up writting a lot of quick, spaghetti code at the end just so I can be done with it
- The UI was written really quickly, but the game was written well (could use refactoring of course)
- Prob spent about 1 day on this in total? Maybe a couple more hours than that
